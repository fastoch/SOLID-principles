# Single responsibility principle

Each class should have a single responsibility.  
Giving a class multiple responsibilities implies **more chances to introduce bugs** when you modify your class.  

Besides, having one class per functionality makes **team work easier** by allowing each developer to work on a specific file.  
Meaning **less merge conflicts** when the work is done and all devs push their code to the repository.

# Open/closed principle
